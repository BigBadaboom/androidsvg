  <!-- The following logic simulates drawing a marker 
       at final vertex of the path. -->
  <!-- First off, move the origin of the user coordinate system
       so that the origin is now aligned with the end point of the path. -->
  <g transform="translate(2500,1250)" >
    <!-- Rotate the coordinate system 45 degrees because
         the marker specified orient="auto" and the final segment
         of the path is going in the direction of 45 degrees. -->
    <g transform="rotate(45)" >
      <!-- Scale the coordinate system to match the coordinate system
           indicated by the 'markerUnits' attributes, which in this case has
           a value of 'strokeWidth'. Therefore, scale the coordinate system
           by the current value of the 'stroke-width' property, which is 100. -->
      <g transform="scale(100)" >
        <!-- Translate the coordinate system by 
             (-refX*viewBoxToMarkerUnitsScaleX, -refY*viewBoxToMarkerUnitsScaleY)
             in order that (refX,refY) within the marker will align with the vertex.
             In this case, we use the default value for preserveAspectRatio
             ('xMidYMid meet'), which means find a uniform scale factor
             (i.e., viewBoxToMarkerUnitsScaleX=viewBoxToMarkerUnitsScaleY)
             such that the viewBox fits entirely within the viewport ('meet') and 
             is center-aligned ('xMidYMid'). In this case, the uniform scale factor
             is markerHeight/viewBoxHeight=3/10=.3. Therefore, translate by
             (-refX*.3,-refY*.3)=(0*.3,-5*.3)=(0,-1.5). -->
        <g transform="translate(0,-1.5)" >
          <!-- There is an implicit clipping path because the user agent style
               sheet says that the 'overflow' property for markers has the value
               'hidden'. To achieve this, create a clipping path at the bounds
               of the viewport. Note that in this case the viewport extends
               0.5 units to the left and right of the viewBox due to 
               a uniform scale factor, different ratios for markerWidth/viewBoxWidth
               and markerHeight/viewBoxHeight, and 'xMidYMid' alignment -->

            <!-- Scale the coordinate system by the uniform scale factor
                 markerHeight/viewBoxHeight=3/10=.3 to set the coordinate
                 system to viewBox units. -->

              <!-- This 'g' element carries all property values that result from
                   cascading and inheritance of properties on the original 'marker' element.
                   In this example, neither fill nor stroke was specified on the 'marker'
                   element or any ancestors of the 'marker', so the initial values of
                   "black" and "none" are used, respectively. -->
