/**
 * Resolver class used by the renderer when resolving font, image, and external CSS references.
 * <p>
 * When AndroidSVG encounters a reference to an external object, such as an image, it will call the
 * associated method on this class in an attempt to load it.
 * <p>
 * The default behaviour of each method is to tell AndroidSVG that the reference could not be found.
 * Extend this class and override the methods if you want to customise how AndroidSVG treats font, image, and external CSS references.
 *
 * <h3>Example usage</h3>
 *
 * <pre class="code-block">
 * {@code
 * public class MyResolver {
 *    // Override the default method implementations with your own.
 *    // See the code for SimpleAssetResolver class, for examples of how to do that.
 * }
 *
 * // Register your resolver with AndroidSVG
 * SVG.registerExternalFileResolver(new MyResolver());
 *
 * // Your resolver will now be used when an SVG is parsed or rendered,
 * SVG mySVG = SVG.getFromX();
 * }

    * <p>
    * An implementation of this method should return a {@code Typeface} instance, or null
    * if you want the renderer to ignore this font request.
    * <p>
    * Note that AndroidSVG does not attempt to cache Typeface references.  If you want
    * them cached, for speed or memory reasons, you should do so yourself.
    * <p>
    * If you return are using Android O or later, and return a variable Truetype or Opentype font,
    * then AndroidSVG will automatically set the weight, stretch and oblique slant for you. Note that
    * it is quite rare for variable fonts to include the italic variant. Commonly, there will be two
    * files, one with the regular glyphs and one with the italic ones.  In those cases, use the
    * {code fontStyle} parameter to choose between those two font files, and leave AndroidSVG to do
    * the rest.
    * <p>
    * Note: Prior to version 1.5 of AndroidSVG, this method did not take a {@code fontStretch}
    * parameter.  Also, as of 1.5, the {@code fontStyle} parameter will now pass lower-case style
    * names that match the CSS {@code font-style} values. For example "italic". Prior to 1.5, you
    * would have received "Italic" (capital 'I') instead.
    *
    * @param fontFamily Font family name, as specified in a font-family style attribute.
    * @param fontWeight Font weight as specified in a font-weight style attribute (typically 100 - 900).
    * @param fontStyle  Font style as specified in a font-style style attribute ("normal",
    *                   "italic", "oblique").
    * @param fontStretch  Font stretch as specified in a font-stretch style attribute. It is treated
    *                     as a percentage value, where 100 maps to "normal". The typical range is
    *                     between 50 ("ultra-condensed") and 200 ("ultra-expanded").
